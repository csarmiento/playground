// In this code, you call the foreach method on args, and pass in a function. In
// this case, youâ€™re passing in a function literal that takes one parameter named
// arg. The body of the function is println(arg). If you type the above code
// into a new file named pa.scala, and execute with the command:

args.foreach(arg => println(arg))
